# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Prediction

This project applies machine learning to predict whether a patient is likely to be readmitted within 30 days after discharge. It forms part of an AI Development Workflow case study focused on improving healthcare outcomes using data-driven insights.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Problem:** High readmission rates negatively affect hospital performance and patient health.
- **Goal:** Build a predictive model to help hospitals identify high-risk patients and take preventive actions.
- **Approach:** Logistic Regression model trained on simulated hospital data including patient age, admission history, length of stay, and chronic conditions.

## 📊 Features Used

- `age`: Patient's age
- `num_prev_admissions`: Number of past hospital admissions
- `length_of_stay`: Number of days stayed during last visit
- `chronic_condition`: Whether the patient has chronic illnesses (1 = yes, 0 = no)
